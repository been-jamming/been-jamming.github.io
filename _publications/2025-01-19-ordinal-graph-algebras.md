We introduce a class of left-cancellative categories we call ordinal graphs for which there is a functor \\(d:\Lambda \rightarrow \mathrm{Ord}\\) by which morphisms of \\(\Lambda\\) factor. We use generators and relations to study the Cuntz-Krieger algebra \\(\mathcal{O}(\Lambda)\\) defined by Spielberg. In particular, we construct a \\(\mathrm{C}^*\\)-correspondence \\(X_\alpha\\) for each \\(\alpha \in \mathrm{Ord}\\) in order to apply Eryüzlü and Tomforde's condition (S) and prove a Cuntz-Krieger uniqueness theorem for ordinal graphs.
