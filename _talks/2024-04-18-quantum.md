In this talk we introduce Quantum mechanics from first principles. We illustrate how Stone's theorem and the Stone-von Neumann theorem bridge the gap between the canonical commutation relations for unbounded operators and the Weyl relations for unitary groups. Time permitting, we'll recast the Stone-von Neumann theorem in terms of \\(C^\*\\) crossed products and discuss how this motivates natural generalizations of the Stone-von Neumann theorem.
