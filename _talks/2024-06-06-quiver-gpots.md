Topological quivers are a somewhat natural generalization of topological graphs, where we insist that edge space is additionally endowed with a family of Radon measures, indexed by the vertex space, satisfying some regularity conditions.  In this series of talks, we aim to present the needed background material to understand what a topological quiver \\(C^\*\\)-algebra is, as well as discuss some results we hope to generalize from Deaconu, Kumjian and Quigg in the topological graph setting.  One of these main results being that a locally compact group acting freely and properly on a topological quiver induces a Morita equivalence between the reduced crossed product of the quiver \\(C^\*\\)-algebra and the \\(C^\*\\)-algebra of the corresponding 'quotient quiver'.
