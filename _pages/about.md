I'm a mathematics PhD. student at Arizona State Univeristy. I do research in operator algebras, the mathematics underpinning quantum mechanics. Lately I've been working on Cuntz-Pimsner algebras and \\(C^*\\)-algebras arising from combinatorial structures. You can see my research projects by navigating to the [Research](https://been-jamming.github.io/publications) tab.

My journey into math started in 2010 when I began to make software. For years I developed a library of small personal projects that I've archived on [github](https://github.com/been-jamming). When I joined ASU as an undergrad in 2018, I originally planned to major in both math and computer science; however, I soon realized it would be more fulfilling to spend all of attention on math. Working with Andrew Bremner, in 2020 I wrote my (quite unpolished) [undergraduate thesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.06233) on using a computer search to find elliptic curves over \\(\mathbb{Q}\\) with many integral points and graduated in 2021. In the fall I joined as a doctoral student and soon began working in \\(C^*\\)-algebras under supervision of John Quigg.

Aside from math and computing, I enjoy rock climbing, roller skating, and listening to music.
